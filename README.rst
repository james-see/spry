2. Puts all found data into a single PDF (username-report.pdf) in the directory that you ran the command from.
3. Progress DOTS and nice COLOURS assuming your terminal supports it.
4. Randomized pausing between lookups so you don't get blocked.
5. Randomized list of +8500 User Agent strings in use by default (can override via -u arg).
6. Proxy override via -p arg.
